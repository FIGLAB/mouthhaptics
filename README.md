#### Step 1: Assemble driver board
Assemble the Ultraino driver board following <a href="www.instructables.com/Ultrasonic-Array/">these instructions</a>

#### Step 2: Assemble the Ultrasound array
- First, determine the polarity of every transducer. You can do this with an oscilloscope + function generator or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HaKv3aJQWA">a multimeter</a>.
- Solder the female MOLEX connectors onto the PCB. You can use any combination of normal/right angle MOLEX connector.
- Create ribbon cables with two male MOLEX ends, to connect the two PCBs.
- Make sure the transducers are all
