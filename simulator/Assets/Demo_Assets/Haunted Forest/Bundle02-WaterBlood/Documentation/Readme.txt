Liquids - NeatWolf's Particle FX Pack 02

This FX Pack is mainly oriented to generic Liquids, Water and Blood

How to use:

- Open the NeatWolf folder in your Project View
- Open the desired category you have in mind: (eg: fog)
- Drop the prefab onto the scene, and you're ready to go!

All the assets are built to be easily tweakable and recolorable, within the limits of Unity

Feel free to duplicate the prefab and move it in another folder of your project if you like to make small adjustments: it'll help when updating the package: you'll get the new updated version of the prefab while still keeping your changes.
